# shyft-labs

To run the project locally, we need to first have MongoDB installed locally. If it is not installed on your machine please follow this link for instructions: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/.

Once MongoDB is installed, ensure that it is running locally and the local running MongoDB port matches the port in shyftlabs-backend-martin/index.js "dbURI" variable.

We also need to have Node installed locally. Please follow this link if you do not have it installed: https://nodejs.org/en.

BACKEND:

Install all dependencies with: npm install. 
Run the backend application by running the command: node index.js. If the backend connects to the DB properly, you will be notified in the console.

FRONTEND:

Install all dependencies with: npm install. 
Run the frontend application by running the command: npm start. The frontend application will be running on http://localhost:3000/.


The application was built with React.JS on the frontend, Node.JS, express.JS on the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence.
